<h1>Exif Untrasher 1.5.1</h1>

<p>Have you ever formatted your camera’s memory card accidentally or deleted images erroneously? A lot of people have, including myself.</p>

<p>Exif Untrasher is a tool that will try to locate photos in JPEG format on any kind of storage medium (SD card, CF card, memory stick, hard drive, …) and save them to your Mac. It won’t succeed in every case, but a lot of people were very relieved to find out that it did a pretty good job for them. And even if it fails, it doesn’t make things worse, as it does not alter the memory card.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Mount the storage medium (i.e.: make it appear on your Mac’s desktop).</strong> Depending on your camera and usage scenario, this can be accomplished by&nbsp;…
	<ul>
	<li>inserting the storage medium (memory card) in your Mac’s built-in card reader or an external USB card reader</li>
	<li><em>or</em> connecting the camera (with memory card inserted) to the Mac</li>
	<li><em>or</em> or connecting the storage medium (if it is a stick, hard drive, …) to your Mac</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Step 2: Create a disk image (exact copy) of the storage medium.</strong> <em>If you already have a disk image, proceed to the next step.</em> Launch Exif Untrasher. Use the upper “Choose…” button (or ⌘-O) to select the desired volume and save the image anywhere you like.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3: Restore photos.</strong> In the upper area of the window, select the disk image you created in step 2, and in the lower area choose the folder in which any restored photos should be saved. Then, hit the “Start data recovery” button.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4: Wait.</strong></li>
<li>When Exif Untrasher has finished restoration, if will inform you and open the folder you selected in step 3. Please take a careful look at the photos (which Exif Untrasher hopefully found). Ideally, they are all perfectly fine, but it can also happen that some or many of them are damaged (cannot be opened, have color artefacts etc.).</li>
</ul>
